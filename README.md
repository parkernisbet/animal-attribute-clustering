# animal-attribute-clustering
A quick comparison of two (of many) clustering methods for text-based entity classification. This dataset relies on a class / attribute table for grouping together various animal species. With no performance metrics to speak of, my commentary within the .ipynb file is mostly on the quality of the output of each clustering method.
